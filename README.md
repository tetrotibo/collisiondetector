# COLLISION DETECTOR | Retro 2D Game Prototype

Collision Detector is a Python-based utility designed to test and visualize a **pixel-perfect collision detection system** in a retro-style debug environment.

Originally built as a learning tool for **comprehensive gamepad input management**, this prototype lets users interact with dynamic shapes in a minimalist 2D sandbox to fine-tune collision accuracy and control logic.

**Built with Python and Pygame**, the tool combines shape rendering, joystick input, delta time smoothing and real-time overlays to help designers debug and refine core game mechanics with visual clarity.

## Collision & Debug Mechanics

The user navigates a test shape using either a game controller or keyboard. Shapes can be toggled between forms like squares and circles to simulate different object types.

Collisions are detected at the pixel level and visualized in real time using outlines, impact markers and state overlays. The system also handles:
- single-frame inputs
- contact angle feedback
- consistent motion via delta time

Its layered display system and toggle controls allow developers to isolate specific behaviors for in-depth testing.

## Built With

- Python – core logic and control flow
- Pygame – video game library for Python
- VS Code – development environment

## Features

- Pixel-perfect collision detection system with live visual feedback
- Shape toggling for flexible interaction testing
- Comprehensive gamepad input management with single-frame detection
- Real-time overlays: hitboxes, outlines and collisions
- Delta time smoothing for stable and precise movement
- Modular codebase ready for extension and experimentation
